That's my bachelor's degree. I researched super resolution task for object detection. The task was to find ships in the picture and I've checked what contributes can be obtained by super resolution.

When SRCNN is ready to work I've checked how it influence in 2 ways. The first way is just improve quality of original picture and results were about 2-5% better accuracy. ![alt text](/img11_1.png "SRCNN+CNN+original image")​

The second way was to split original picture in 4 pictures and each of then should be upscaled and improved by SRCNN. Results were about 5-10% better accuracy.
